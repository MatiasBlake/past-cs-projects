I made it so that the vertical velocity of the ball increased by a factor of
0.05 with each collision with the paddle. The speed is reset to -4.0 at the
beggining of each try. The maximum speed is set to 8.0 because I believe that
is the highest speed that doesn't cause bugs with a 60Hz refresh rate.

I added a score feature. The score increases every time a brick is destroyed.
The higher up the brick, the larger the increment. The increment is also
proportional to the speed.

Last, I added sound effects using the provided wav files. I used the module
random to select certain sounds.
