Maze solver by Mat√≠as Blake (mb2522) and Chris Pardee (csp73)

solve2 is our main cpp file that runs the maze solver.

generator.html contains javascript we modified to work with our c++ code that outputs a random maze as a c++ array to the debug console. We copy paste these random mazes into the solve2 code to add mazes.

hand_draw_maze.html is a javascript tool we made to hand draw a maze, which outputs mazes to the debug console. This was very useful in initial testing.
